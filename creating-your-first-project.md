### Step 1. Adding Birthdays

&#x20;                     Once Birthdayy has been added to your server, add a birthday using _**/birthday register**_ in the _**dd.mm.yyyy**_ format that’s required. That will allow you to submit the very first birthday date in your server and also let you check if the bot’s custom emojis are working.



### Step 2. Setting Up An Announcement Channel

&#x20;                     For the bot to be able to show the birthday announcement on the day of the birthday, it’s needed to have an assigned announcement channel. By typing _**/config announcement**_ and then choosing the channel to your liking, Birthdayy will be able to successfully remind the server of the member’s birthday.



### Step 3. Choosing A Timezone

&#x20;                     As the default timezone of the bot is _**UTC**_, servers in different parts of the world are required to choose the timezone of their region for the best announcement timing. Using the _**/config timezone**_ command, you can choose your desirable timezone with a simple click.
