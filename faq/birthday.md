# Birthday

## How can I add a Birthday for another Person?

Doing so is super easy! Just add a User parameter after setting the Date of a birthday.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**MANGE ROLES** permission is required for setting Birthdays for other People
{% endhint %}

## How can I remove a Birthday from a user that has left the Discord Server?

If you are sure the member you want to remove the birthday from has left the discord server, you can copy the User ID from theperson by right-clicking on them, then selecting `copy id.` (You need to have Developer Mode activated in Discord).&#x20;

Now type `/birthday remove` and paste the ID in the selection field instead of selecting a user. This should be it!
