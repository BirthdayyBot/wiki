# Quick Start

### Step 1. Adding Birthdays

Once Birthdayy has been added to your server, add a birthday using _**/birthday register**_ in the _**dd.mm.yyyy**_ format that’s required. That allows you to submit the very first birthday date in your server and also let you check if the bot’s custom emojis are working.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want your age to be a secret, type XXXX instead of the year you were born in. For example, _**/birthday register**_ _**01.01.XXXX**_
{% endhint %}

### Step 2. Setting Up An Announcement Channel

For the bot to be able to show the birthday announcement on the day of the birthday, it’s needed to have an assigned announcement channel. By typing _**/config announcement**_ and then choosing the channel to your liking, Birthdayy will be able to successfully remind the server of the member’s birthday.

### Step 3. Choosing A Timezone

As the default timezone of the bot is _**UTC**_, servers in different parts of the world are required to pick the timezone of their region for the best announcement timing. Using the _**/config timezone**_ command, you can select your desirable timezone with a simple click.
