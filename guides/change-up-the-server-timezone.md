# Change up the Server Timezone

The default timezone for the bot has been assigned the _**UTC timezone**_. Many of the Birthdayy bot users live in different places, which means that for the bot to announce a birthday at midnight of a specific timezone, the server owner is required to use _**/config timezone**_  and add the timezone the server is in for the perfect birthday announcement!

{% hint style="warning" %}
The bot can only have one timezone, not different ones for every single member in the server. If your server consists of people around the world, it is advised to come to an agreement with everyone for the best possible timezone for the server to have.
{% endhint %}
