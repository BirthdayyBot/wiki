Everyone should feel special on their birthday, and that's why Birthday has added a _**Birthday Role**_!

If the owner of the server wishes to add a role that last for _**24 hours**_ so everyone can see whose birthday it is, they first need to add a role from the server settings. Once the customizing is done, typing _**/config birthday-role**_ and then clicking on the newly made role, when it's someone's birthday they will acquire the role until the end of the day.&#x20;

If you'd like to test whether you've successfuly connected the correct role, use _**/birthday test**_ to get the role yourself and check out the celebration message!
