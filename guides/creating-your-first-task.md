# Set up a Birthday Role

Everyone should feel special on their birthday, and that's why Birthday gives you the option to assign a _**Birthday Role**_ for a day to the birthday child!

If you wish to gift a special role on someone's birthday, first create a new role and make sure that the Bots role is above the new one. Next, use _**/config birthday-role**_ and select the role that should get assigned. Once you receive the confirmation message, you should be good to go.

#### 1. Create Birthday child role and put the Bot role is above it
