# Set Up a Ping Role

If the owner of the server wishes to add a role that will be sent alongside the birthday announcement, so everyone who wishes to be reminded for every birthday can have, the first thing that needs to be done is to make a new role that will be given to the members. Once the role is made, typing _**/config ping-role**_ and then choosing the freshly added role, all it takes is for an announcement to be sent and the specific role will be pinged to wish a happy birthday!
