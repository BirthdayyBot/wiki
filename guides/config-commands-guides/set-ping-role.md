# Set Up a Ping Role

{% hint style="danger" %}
It is not possible to choose @everyone or @here. Please use a custom role.

If you wish to add a role, that will be sent alongside the birthday announcement, to notify your Server member about a birthday. Type _**/config ping-role**_ and choose the desired role that should get pinged.&#x20;
