# Update Birthdays

Mistyping something while registering your birthday can happen quite often, so instead of removing your birthday and then adding it again, the _**/birthday update**_ can help you with changing it faster.

This way, by simply using the _**/birthday update**_ and then adding the user's name and correct date, Birthdayy will change it and the Birthdayy list will automatically update.

{% hint style="warning" %}
To make sure no one uses the command to their advantage to change their birthday every day, normal members are not able to use this command. So unfortunately, if you would like to change your birthday to the correct date, you need to ask the server own or someone with the _**Manage Roles**_ permission.
{% endhint %}
