# Remove Birthdays

In case a member decides they're not comfortable with sharing their birthday anymore, their birthday date can easily be removed using _**/birthday remove**_ .

If your server role also has the _**Manage Roles**_ permission, all it take is to write the command and then the username of the person that would like to remove their birthday, Birthdayy will immediately remove it from the list and will not announce it anymore..
