# Test your Birthdayy Configuration

How should you know if the bot is set up correctly and if all the roles and channels are working properly after you prepare Birthdayy?&#x20;

All it takes to test out all the customising you've done is as simple as using _ **/birthday test**_ in your server. That will give you the birthday role for 24 hours, will announce your birthday in the announcement channel, but it _**won't**_ change the birthday date that you've already registered so you don't have to worry about registering your correct birthday again.
